For the task 4, me and my group decided to use the IES project to make a pedagogical inspection in our previous work. From this we were surprised to see that we had many security hotspots, related to CORS, and vulnerabilities, in which all were critical. It seemed that we were feeding some unexpected fields on the arguments of the @RequestMapping annotated methods.

We defined a custom quality gate where with a minimum of 80% in coverage, as we felt we should lean our coverage to the maximum reasonable coverage. We gave no tolerance in bugs and vulnerabilities to make our application very assurant. At last, we defined a limit of 200 code smells and 10 duplicated blocks to make our code clean enough and well refactored.
